# Building and Running xv6

## Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL

If you are running windows, you must install WSL2 and choose the Ubuntu 22.04 image.
From there, make sure you install the following:
```
sudo apt install qemu qemu-system-x86 gcc-multilib
```
Then, the original Makefile will work with:
```
make
```
then launch within your terminal with:
```
make qemu-nox
```

## Mac OSX

You need to have [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) installed and then you install the following:
```
brew tap nativeos/i386-elf-toolchain
brew install i386-elf-gcc qemu
```
The `Makefile` is modified to remove a few flags that appear to prevent compilation otherwise.
Use the same process as in Ubuntu to build and run:
```
make
make qemu-nox
```

# Note
MIT stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

# Acknowledgements

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)
